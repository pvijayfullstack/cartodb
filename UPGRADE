There's no standard procedure to migrate from one version to another of
the rails application, so version specific procedures are documented
in the NEWS.md file.

In absence of specific instructions, after upgrading the rails code to
<version>, you must upgrade existing databases using these commands:

$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake cartodb:db:load_functions
$ bundle exec rake cartodb:db:load_triggers
$ bundle exec rake cartodb:db:create_importer_schema
$ bundle exec rake cartodb:db:migrate_to[<version>]

NOTE: rails must be restarted after an upgrade
