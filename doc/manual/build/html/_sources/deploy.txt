Deploy
======

There are two deployment options for CartoDB:

    * `single instance`_ where everything runs in the same machine. 
    * `distributed`_, every component runs in its on machine

.. _single_instance:

single instance
---------------

Single machine instance installation it's useful for simple installations where scalability is not the key.

In this case all the components run as processes:

    * 1 postgres + pgbouncer
    * 1 nginx
    * 1 varnish
    * N editor
    * 1 batch machines (same editor code)
    * 1 SQL API
    * 1 Maps PI

.. _distributed:

distributed
---------------

Distributed installation is meant for enviorments where scalability and performanc are important, the setup is more complex since each component requires 1 or more machines

    * 1 postgres + pgbouncer
    * 1 nginx
    * 1 varnish
    * N editor
    * 1 batch machines (same editor code)
    * 1 SQL API
    * 1 Maps PI
