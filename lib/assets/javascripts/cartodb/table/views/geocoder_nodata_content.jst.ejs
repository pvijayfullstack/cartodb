<p>If you have tried georeference your table, you should have a column called 'cartodb_georef_status'. It indicates which rows have been georeferenced, <strong>true</strong> value for the success and <strong>false</strong> value for the failed.</p>
<p class="margin20">We haven't found any row with a <strong>NULL</strong> value this time. Try changing those values or just removing that column and then try again.</p>
