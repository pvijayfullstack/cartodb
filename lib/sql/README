SQL files in the scripts-enabled directory (*.sql) will be loaded
into newly created user databases.

You can install/upgrade functions in all known users databases
with the cartodb:db:load_function rake target:

  rake cartodb:db:load_functions

The test/ directory contains regression testing for the functions
you can run against all user databases using:

  rspec spec/lib/sql_test_spec.rb
