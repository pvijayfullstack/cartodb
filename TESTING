The procedure to run cartodb tests is as follows:

  # Prepare test database
  bundle exec rake db:test:prepare

  # Run all specs
  # I don't really know, but this is one of them :)
  rspec spec/lib/sql_test_spec.rb

CartoDB is a large app.
We reccomend you use the [spin gem](https://github.com/jstorimer/spin/)
to load the main application into memory while you are testing.
