Testing CartoDB
===============

CartoDB tests are based on [Ruby Spec](http://rspec.info/).
The procedure to run them is as follows:

  # Prepare test database
  bundle exec rake db:test:prepare

  # Run all specs
  bundle exec rspec

If you want to run specific tests, rather than all of them, you
can specify them on the `rspec` command line, like:

  bundle exec spec/lib/sql_test_spec.rb

CartoDB is a large app.
We recommend you use the [spin gem](https://github.com/jstorimer/spin/)
to load the main application into memory while you are testing.
