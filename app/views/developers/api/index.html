    <h1>CartoDB API</h1>

    <p>CartoDB offers a REST API that allows you to interact with your tables, fetch rows and perform common database operations + GIS operations in a easy way.</p>

    <h2>Overwiew</h2>

    <p>As a CartoDB user, you can create tables to store your data. Every table, which can be public or private, is composed by a set of rows and a set of columns and is identified by a name, which is unique in your database.</p>

    <p>Every column has a name, which identifies it and a type. The available types are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Number</li>
      <li>Date</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every row is identified by our primary key, which is a column named <code>cartodb_id</code>.</p>

    <p>You need to be authenticated when performing API requests. Refer to the <a href="/api/authentication">Authentication section</a> to get more information.</p>

    <h2>Endpoint</h2>

    <p>The endpoint is <code>http://api.cartodb.com/</code>. You should perform all the request to this host.</p>
